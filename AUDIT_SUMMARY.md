## Root Causes

### Issue #1 & #3: SPA Routing (HTML-as-JSON Error)

**Root Cause:**  
Encore backend has no static service to serve the Vite SPA. When the frontend requests `/auth/clerk-config`, it may encounter routing issues or receive HTML 404 pages instead of JSON, causing `JSON.parse()` to fail with:

```
Error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE ..." is not valid JSON
```

**Fix:**  
- Add `base: '/frontend/'` to `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Create `backend/frontend/encore.service.ts` with static handler at `/frontend/*`
- Build SPA into `backend/frontend/dist/`

**Files:** `frontend/vite.config.ts:6`, `backend/frontend/static.ts` (new), `backend/package.json:7`

---

### Issue #2: Vitest Environment

**Root Cause:**  
`frontend/vitest.config.ts` uses `environment: 'happy-dom'` while tests import `@testing-library/jest-dom`, which requires full DOM APIs. The `jsdom` package is not installed.

**Fix:**  
- Change to `environment: 'jsdom'`
- Add `jsdom` to devDependencies

**Files:** `frontend/vitest.config.ts:7`, `frontend/package.json:39`

---

### Issue #4: Missing Secret Documentation

**Root Cause:**  
No `.env.example` file exists. Users must guess secret names and formats.

**Fix:**  
Create `.env.example` with all 5 required secrets:
- ClerkSecretKey
- ClerkPublishableKey
- SentryDSN
- OpenAI_API_Key
- Anthropic_API_Key

**Files:** `.env.example` (new), `README.md:31-36`

---

### Issue #5, #6, #7: Sentry Security

**Root Cause:**  
`backend/monitoring/sentry.ts` has production-unsafe defaults:
1. `tracesSampleRate: 1.0` → 100% of transactions captured (expensive)
2. `sendDefaultPii: true` → Leaks IP addresses, User-Agent, cookies
3. Frontend has no source maps → Unreadable stack traces

**Fix:**  
- Set sampling to 10% in production: `process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? 0.1 : 1.0`
- Disable PII: `sendDefaultPii: false`
- Enable frontend source maps: `"sourceMap": true` in tsconfig

**Files:** `backend/monitoring/sentry.ts:9-10`, `frontend/tsconfig.json:14`

---

### Issue #8: Missing CI/CD

**Root Cause:**  
No GitHub Actions workflow exists. Tests and builds are manual.

**Fix:**  
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
- Bun setup for backend/frontend
- Test execution (both packages)
- Coverage collection
- Build verification
- Artifact upload

**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new)

---

### Issue #9: Rate Limiting Scalability

**Root Cause:**  
`backend/security/ratelimit.ts:19` uses in-memory `Map` storage. Won't scale horizontally (each instance has isolated state).

**Fix:**  
Documentation-only (per prompt requirements):
- Add inline comments explaining limitation
- Create `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md` with Redis migration guide
- No code changes

**Files:** `backend/security/ratelimit.ts:18-26` (comments), `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md` (new)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Chosen Approach: Strategy A (Vite Base Path)

**Decision:** Serve SPA at `/frontend/*` instead of root

**Rationale:**
1. **Least invasive** – No conflicts with existing API routes at root
2. **Clear separation** – API at `/`, static assets at `/frontend/`
3. **Easy rollback** – Remove `base` property and static service

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Strategy B (serve SPA at root): Would require changing all backend API paths or complex route prioritization

## PR Roadmap

```
PR #1: .env.example template
  ↓
PR #2: Vite/Encore routing fix  ← Blocks PR #3, #5
  ↓
PR #3: Vitest jsdom environment ← Unblocks CI tests
  ↓
PR #4: Sentry hardening (parallel)
  ↓
PR #5: CI pipeline (requires #2, #3)
  ↓
PR #6: Rate limit docs (parallel)
```

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 2-4 hours (all PRs)  
**Merge Strategy:** Merge in sequence (1→6) to avoid conflicts

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated Checks
```bash
# After each PR merge:
1. Run smoke tests (SMOKE.md)
2. Check acceptance criteria (ACCEPTANCE.md)
3. Monitor CI dashboard
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Critical paths:
1. Load SPA: http://localhost:4000/frontend/
2. Sign in via Clerk
3. Create idea → Analyze
4. Check Sentry dashboard (no PII, readable traces)
5. Trigger rate limit (101 requests in 1 minute)
```

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Zero "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- ✅ All tests pass (backend + frontend)
- ✅ CI green on main branch
- ✅ Sentry sampling at 10% (prod)
- ✅ No PII in Sentry events
- ✅ Coverage ≥ 85% for changed modules

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Vite base path breaks existing routes | Low | High | Rollback diff, use Strategy B |
| jsdom incompatibility with tests | Low | Medium | Keep happy-dom, fix tests differently |
| Sentry sampling too low in prod | Medium | Low | Start at 0.2 (20%), adjust based on volume |
| CI workflow syntax errors | Low | Low | Validate YAML before commit |
| Redis migration breaks rate limits | N/A | N/A | Documentation-only, no immediate risk |

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 **Low** (all fixes are reversible with documented rollback steps)

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Per-PR Rollback
```bash
# Example: PR #2 causes issues
git revert <pr-2-commit-sha>
git push origin main

# Or manual:
git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/vite.config.ts backend/frontend/
rm -rf backend/frontend/dist
git commit -m "Rollback PR #2: Vite base path"
```

### Full Audit Rollback
```bash
# Revert to pre-audit state
git reset --hard <commit-before-fixes>
git push origin main --force

# Or revert each PR in reverse:
git revert <pr-6-commit>
git revert <pr-5-commit>
# ... continue to PR #1
```

---

## Post-Implementation Monitoring

### 24-Hour Observation (Critical)
- [ ] Check Sentry error rate (should remain stable or decrease)
- [ ] Monitor Sentry event volume (should be ~10% of previous in prod)
- [ ] Verify CI runs on all new PRs
- [ ] Check frontend asset load times (should be <2s)

### 7-Day Review
- [ ] Analyze Sentry cost (should decrease ~90% in prod)
- [ ] Review CI/CD performance (build time trends)
- [ ] Check rate limit stats (any abuse patterns)
- [ ] Gather developer feedback on workflow changes

### 30-Day Assessment
- [ ] Decision: Keep current rate limiting or migrate to Redis
- [ ] Review Sentry sampling rate (adjust if needed)
- [ ] Archive audit artifacts to `docs/audits/2025-10-30/`

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. ✅ **Static Path Strategy:** Chose Strategy A (`/frontend/*`) over root serving
2. ✅ **Vitest Environment:** Standardized on jsdom (not happy-dom)
3. ✅ **Sentry Sampling:** 10% in prod, 100% in dev
4. ✅ **Rate Limit Migration:** Documentation-only (no immediate Redis move)
5. ✅ **CI Platform:** GitHub Actions with Bun
6. ✅ **Source Maps:** Enabled in both frontend and backend

---

## Encore + Vite Integration Checklist

✅ **Static Service Pattern:**
```typescript
// backend/frontend/static.ts
export const serveFrontend = api.static(
  { path: "/frontend/*path", dir: "./dist" }
);
```

✅ **Vite Base Configuration:**
```typescript
// frontend/vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/frontend/',
  // ...
});
```

✅ **Build Process:**
```bash
# From backend/
bun run build
# → Builds frontend into backend/frontend/dist/
```

✅ **Asset Resolution:**
- SPA: `http://localhost:4000/frontend/`
- Assets: `http://localhost:4000/frontend/assets/*.js`
- API: `http://localhost:4000/ideas`, `/auth`, etc.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Encore Static Services:** Must be explicitly defined (no auto-discovery)
2. **Vite Base Path:** Critical for SPA served under non-root paths
3. **Testing Library:** Requires jsdom, not happy-dom
4. **Sentry Defaults:** Production-unsafe out-of-the-box (must harden)
5. **Leap.new Secrets:** Use Settings UI or `encore secret set` (no .env files)

---
